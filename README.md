# Utilities-and-Operations-Scripts
> Synchronization Scripts

The scripts are used to periodically run specific operations in the ESCAPE DataLake.
The scripts runs the CRIC-Rucio, IAM-Rucio, and IAM-EOSgridmap synchronizations, as well as Rucio noise and gfal-sam-testing.
The containers using these scripts can be found at https://github.com/ESCAPE-WP2/DataLake-Crons .

Additional useful scripts can be found in cric-info-tools.
The scripts to update the proxies run on CERN LXPLUS/AIADM service as acron jobs under `egazzarr` account.
